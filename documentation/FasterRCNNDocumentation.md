### Kidney Raw Data
This work utilized a dataset of human kidney whole slide images provided by the HuBMAP Consortium, which is now available at [the HuBMAP Data Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/search?origin_sample.mapped_organ[0]=Kidney%20%28Left%29&origin_sample.mapped_organ[1]=Kidney%20%28Right%29&group_name[0]=Vanderbilt%20TMC&entity_type[0]=Dataset). The raw kidney image data was generated by the BIOmolecular Multimodal Imaging Center (BIOMIC) at Vanderbilt University. (See https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/biomic/ for more information.) This dataset is composed of 13 samples, each with multiple images that correspond to different microscopy types. All samples include PAS  stain images, and many include imaging mass spectrometry as well. In addition, this dataset provides information on where the sample was positioned within the kidney and whether it was taken from a left or right kidney, which is vital information for the HuBMAP objective.
